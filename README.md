- Hello, I’m @JuniMagi !
- This account is mostly for learning.
-   Also a way to document my improvement.
- Incoming College Freshman in BSCS
- I'm currently a beginner.
-   I’m currently interested in learning web development(html, js, css) and automation(py).
-   The projects I make are for fun as I have no prior experience except Arduino IDE.
- Please don't reach me, please.
